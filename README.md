# Real-Time-Object-Classification-Using-a-CNN-Model
The goal of this project is to build a real-time object classification system that distinguishes between
transparent, colorful, and black objects. We achieve this by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
model from scratch, as pre-trained models are not allowed. Once trained, the model can be used to classify
objects captured in real-time via a webcam.
